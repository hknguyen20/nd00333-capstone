# Capstone Project - Azure ML Engineer

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

## Dataset

### Overview
This is the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset taken from Kaggle [link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It consists of 11 features and 1 target (HeartDisease: 1,0)

### Task
The task is Classification, with the HeartDisease target: 1 is patient having heart disease and 0 is not having. As there are relatively few features, I will use all 11 of them.

### Access
I uploaded the dataset to github and access the dataset using URL. I access using Dataset.Tabular and register dataset to workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response
